# ST516-Project-2
Optimizing Process Parameters Using Design of Experiments

## Probelm Statement

You are working for a manufacturer of optical fiber and a new design is being
introduced. One of the most important attributes of a fiber is optical signal attenuation,
which we want to minimize.
Your project team wants to run a process experiment to determine the best
combination of settings for the fiber drawing process as well as a few other
characteristics to minimize attenuation. They have identified the following factors to
investigate:
* Fiber draw speed (ranges from 20-30 m/sec)
* Furnace temperature (ranges from 1800-2200 C‚Å∞)
* Draw tension (ranges from 0.5 to 1.0N)
* Germanium concentration (ranges from 0.01 to 0.05)
* Fiber design 1 or 2 (index of refraction profile)
* Draw tower 1 or 2 (one of two manufacturing lines able to make the fiber)
* Raw material supplier 1 or 2 (one of two potential glass material suppliers)
* Coating type 1 or 2 (one of two coatings compatible with the designs)

The project has two objectives:
1. Identify any significant main effects and interactions on attenuation from the list
of identified factors
2. Build a model to predict attenuation from the significant factors, and generate a
list of optimal settings/characteristics based on that model.

You department has budgeted $100,000 for the experimental runs, which cost $1,000
per run. It is possible to get addition money for the project if needed, but that may
result in negative feedback on your annual performance review (i.e., lost points on your
grade). Also, the manufacturing engineering department has told you they can run up
to 16 experimental runs per day.
